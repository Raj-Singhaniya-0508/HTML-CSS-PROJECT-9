# HTML-CSS-PROJECT-05

This project explores the use of the Flex property , position margin and padding in HTML/CSS.

# Description

In this project, I have learnt the Flex property, which is a powerful tool in CSS. With the Flex property, I was able to easily manipulate the arrangement of elements within a container, adjusting their size, alignment, and order as needed.
